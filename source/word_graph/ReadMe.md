```
{
        "dictionary":
        {
                "language": "en",
                "words": {
                        "a": { "parts": [ "preposition" ] }
				}
		}
}

The word list is an object and each entry is a word (unsurprisingly) with the parts of speech as  an array
of words. This is a little verbose but will be easy to amend.
